<h3>Creating unheard noises</h3>
<img src="mail-adr.gif"><br>
Last updated: jan 2012
</center>
<p>
This program is meant as a demo for the SDL-widgets toolkit, also it could be useful
for sound designers.
<p>
Hitting the <b>play</b> button will start or stop the generation of sound. If sound is playing and you like
it, then it can be written it to a WAVE file (44100Hz, stereo),
by clicking the <b>write sound</b> button (which normally is hidden).
Sound as well as writing is stopped by re-clicking the play button.
<p>
There are 4 parts.
<h2>Waves</h2>
<center><img src="make-waves.png"></center>
<p>
You can add points to the waveforms and listen to the result. With the choice box <b>Mode</b>
a waveform can be selected. Also wave B can amplitude- or frequency-modulate wave A. Then 2 sliders
will pop up: <b>AM amount</b> or <b>FM amount</b> to control the modulation,
<b>A/B detune</b> to control detuning of the A versus the B frequency.
Wave B can also be used as a trigger for wave A. This
way the perceived frequency is that of B, with formants depending on the frequency and waveform
of A. The frequencies of A and B can be choosen with the 2-dimensional slider.
<p>
To draw points in the waveforms:<br>
Left mouse button: If you click on an existing point, it can be be moved.
Clicking somewhere else will result in the creation of a new point. In both cases a new smooth
waveform will be drawn.<br>
Middle mouse button: if you click on an existing point, it will be erased.
<p>
The state of the program can be saved to a file named x.mw by clicking the <b>save</b>
button. Afterwards this file can be renamed to a more descriptive name. The next time the program can
be started with this filename as option.
<h2>Bouncy</h2>
<center><img src="bouncy.png"></center>
<p>
The idea for this program came from a file with included comment "Adam's Bouncy Thing", where
I don't know the author of. For this project sound was added: what you see is what you hear.
The red blobs act as "masses", the lines as "springs".
You can grab one of the masses with the mouse, release it, and see the masses
and springs moving. Movements in the x direction can be heard from the left speaker, movements in the y
direction from the right one. The mass with the black dot is the pickup point, it is used for sound output.
The square green masses are fixed. With the middle button any mass can be toggled between fixed and free.
<p>
The spring constant and the masses can be modified with a slider, yielding different base frequencies.
The value of the masses in the x and the y direction can be detuned
with the <b>x/y asymmetry</b> slider, which may result in interesting interferences.
<p>
The <b>Input</b> radio button:
<dl>
<dt>mouse<dd>You move and release the masses with the mouse.</dd>
<dt>mouse, noise burst<dd>Idem, at that a burst of pink noise is added.</dd>
<dt>pink noise<dd>At the left fixed mass noise is injected, yielding a steady sound.</dd>
<dt>feedback<dd>From the mass with the black dot a signal is fed back to the left fixed mass.</dd>
</dl>
The <b>check boxes</b>:
<dl>
<dt>freeze<dd>The masses are froozen, but can be moved with the mouse. After unchecking the box you can hear
the result.</dd>
<dt>low friction<dd>Internally, the damping factor for the graphics model has a much higher value than that of
the audio model, in order to make their decay times equal. If this box is checked, the graphics model gets
a low damping too, yielding a visually very long decay time.</dd>
<dt>non-linear<dd>The spring constants will become dependent on the spring length: longer length &rarr;
stiffer spring.</dd>
<dt>open ended<dd>The right-side fixed point bcomes movable, and the pickup point is moved to the right.
This yields a differend sound spectrum.</dd>
</dl>
The movement of the masses is softly clipped near the window edges. You can hear that in the
sound also.
<h2>Harmonics</h2>
<center><img src="harmonics.png"></center>
<p>
Here you can create a custom frequency spectrum. The leftmost bar is the base tone, the rest of the bars
are the harmonics. The base frequency is controlled with the <b>frequency</b> slider.
The individual amplitudes can be modified with the left mouse button.
<p>
With the right mouse button one or more harmonics can be selected. Then, with slider <b>sel: freq offset</b>
their frequency can be shifted, which might yield interesting beating sounds.
Frequency-shifted harmonics will be drawn in a blue color.
With slider <b>sel: ampl multiply</b> the amplitude of the selected harmonics can be modified,
which can be used to simulate filters.
If slider <b>add distorsion</b> is in the left-most position, the basic waveform is a pure sinusoid, whereas a modified
sinusoid will be used at other slider positions. With slider <b>noise mode</b> noise can be added in several ways.
In the right-most position the basic waveform will not be a pure sinusoid, but an unsteady one. 
<p>
With the middle mouse button one harmonic can be choosen whose data will
be listed in the <b>info</b> window.
<p>
Also some soft signal-clipping can be introduced. The effect will be visible in the oscilloscope
window. If checkbox <b>only clip base freq</b> is on, then only the base frequency-component will
be clipped. With checkbox <b>randomized frequency</b> the frequency
of the harmonics will contain a small random component.
<p>
The settings can be saved in file x.wm, as described in the Waves chapter.
<h2>Filters</h2>
<center><img src="filters.png"></center>
<p>
This is a utility to display the transfer curve of digital filters. You can add your own
filter in file filter-test.cpp. A filter must be a subclass of class <tt>FilterBase</tt> and must
implement 3 methods:
<dl>
<dt><tt>void init(float cutoff,float fq)</tt><dd>
Initialization.
<tt>cutoff</tt> is the cutoff frequency in Hz, <tt>fq</tt> is the filter quality factor.</dd>
<dt><tt>float getSample(float input)</tt><dd>
The transfer function.</dd>
<dt><tt>const char *get_mode(int nr)</tt><dd>
Input is the number associated with a button of the choice-box labelled <b>filter</b>
(<tt>test_filter</tt> in the main program).
The function should return a suitable filter name.</dd>
</dl>
It is difficult to explain all this in a few words, so please look at the code in filter-test.cpp.

In the main file 2 statements must be added. Suppose your new filter is called
"my-filter" and its associated class is MyFilter, then add<br>
<tt>test_filter->add_rbut("my-filter")</tt> in the constructor of FilterTest, and<br>
<tt>case 3: filt->the_filter=new MyFilter(); break;</tt><br>
in function test_filt_cmd(...).
<p>
In the GUI, clicking the <b>play</b> button will generate a 200Hz pulse-formed signal filtered by the current
filter. The <b>range</b> slider controls the frequency range that is displayed. In its highest
position the range is 0 - 30000Hz, so it will contain also the Nyquist frequency (equal to half
of the sampling frequency, which is 44100Hz). The Nyquist frequency is indicated by a red line.
To display high-gain filters correctly, <b>log ampl scale</b> can be checked, in which case
the logarithm of the amplitude is shown. The frequency
scale can be shown logarithmically if <b>log freq scale</b> is checked.
