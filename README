======== SDL2-widgets, GUI toolkit using the SDL2 library ========

Version 2.1 - june 2014

This version is built on SDL2. Hardware accelleration can be used locally. However,
floating, movable subwindows only work in the parts that use software rendering.
Font library SDL2_ttf is used. Graphics library SDL_gfx is not used, though recently
it has been ported to SDL2 also. A temporary replacement is provided: shapes.cpp.

SDL2-widgets is aiming at normal, possibly complicated, threaded applications. 
With hardware accelleration enabled it is also useable for games that SDL is used 
for mostly.

The toolkit has been tested on Linux (Fedora) and on Windows via MinGW (thanks to
Javier Carracedo). For Windows, please also read Build-on-Windows.txt.

For more information, read  doc/sdl-widgets.html. There are 3 example  applications,
their doc files are accessable from doc/index.html.

To compile, run
  ./configure

This is a very minimal test whether a compiler and the SDL2 libraries are present on 
your system. Two true-type fonts are needed, in this version these are included.
If configure was succesful, run
  make

This will generate:
  sdl-widgets.a			- the widget library
  testsw			- a demo program
  hello/hello			- you guess it
  make-waves/make-waves		- 4 small audio applications
  bouncy-tune/bouncy-tune	- compose and play tunes with physical-modelled instruments

In testsw.cpp, there is a widget draw_lissajoux, which can serve as an example of 
accellerated rendering. It will be displayed if the vertical slider is moved. Notice
that a floating widget (e.g. the alert box) will erase this widget, and that it will not
be covered by the floating widget if it is redrawn.

There is no 'make intall', probably it's not needed because this toolkit is simple.
