STEPS TO BUILD ON WINDOWS WITH MINGW
====================================

You will need MSYS to run configure and make

(1) There are 2 truetype files: DroidSans.ttf and DroidSansMono.ttf
(2) Run command: ./configure
(3) Run make
(4) To run, every executable will need in their own folder both TTFs.
    They also need (either installed or in their folder) all these DLLS:

	SDL2.dll
	SDL2_ttf.dll
	libfreetype-6.dll
	libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll
	libstdc++-6.dll


Be careful with step 2!!
Using absolute folders WILL NOT WORK because of the different path notation

  MSYS     -->   /c/some/path
  WINDOWS  -->   c:\some\path
